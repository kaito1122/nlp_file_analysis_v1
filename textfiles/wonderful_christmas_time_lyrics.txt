The mood is right
The spirits up
We’re here tonight
And that’s enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party’s on
The feeling’s here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding ooh ooh
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do

We’re simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
So lift a glass
Oh and don’t look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong (dong)
Ding dong, ding dong (dong)
Ding dong, dong dong

The party’s on
The spirits up
We’re here tonight
And that’s enough (ohh)

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We’re simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The mood is right
The spirits up
We’re here tonight
Oh and that’s enough (yeah)

We’re simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Wonderful Christmastime (Christmas)
